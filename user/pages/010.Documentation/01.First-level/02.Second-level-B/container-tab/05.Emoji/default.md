!= This website has an active **Emoji embedding plugin**!
This plugin automatically converts shortcodes into emoji images. It works very simply – just type the code surrounded by colons.

!!= Note that the website is responsive, and the size of the Emojis adapts to the page width and text. Therefore, their size is different when displayed on a PC versus a mobile device.

### How to Write Emojis?

To insert an emoji, simply type it's text shortcode, you can find on [emojiguide](https://emojiguide.org/) page. Here are a few examples:

*   For a smile, type `:smile:` --> :smile: or 🙂 or &#128578;
*   For a heart, type `:heart:` --> :heart: or ❤️  or &#9829;
*   For a rocket, type `:rocket:` --> :rocket: or 🚀 or &#128640;
*   For a thumbs up, type `:thumbsup:` --> :thumbsup: or 👍 or &#128077;

### Size Levels
<p>If the Emojis are too large, you can adjust the size in markdown using classes:</p>
:sweat_smile:{.emoji-size--ultra_big}
:sweat_smile:{.emoji-size--very_big}
:sweat_smile:{.emoji-size--big}
:sweat_smile:{.emoji-size--normal}
:sweat_smile:{.emoji-size--small}
:sweat_smile:{.emoji-size--very_small}
:sweat_smile:{.emoji-size--ultra_small}

The system supports a wide range of standard emoji shortcodes, which you may know from platforms like GitHub, Slack, or Discord.

!!! Experiment and have fun! Try for example: `:tada:`, `:coral:` or `:octopus:` &nbsp; :tada: :coral: :octopus:
