## Notifications and Visual Elements

! Using plugins, you can insert special visual elements into your pages. For example, `Alerts`, `Notices`, and others. Pay attention to the syntax used for writing them, and notice that some visual elements have the option to close them with an 'X'.

Visual elements can "enrich" and improve the readability of pages for users.

### Notices

!= This is an informational message (info).

!!= This is a success message (success).

!!!+= This is a warning (warning) with a close button.

!!!!+= This is a danger (danger) with a close button.

### Alerts

||||+= This is a danger alert with a close button.
