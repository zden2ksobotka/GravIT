## You are in Branch B: Container Demonstration

! This branch demonstrates how to create a menu for grouping several pages.

!! We previously showed the possibilities of navigating to other items `using direct links`. Another option is navigation using automatically generated items by the CMS. These are represented by a directory that does not contain a `default.md` file. Its hyperlink will render the folders that are one level below this folder.

### Explore the content of the container tab

Inside this "container" tab are several pages that demonstrate specific CMS features. Here are direct links to explore them:

**[Text Formatting](/doku/first-level/second-level-b/container-test/text-formatting)**
Shows how to use headings, bold text, lists, and other basic Markdown elements.

**[Plugin Samples](/doku/first-level/second-level-b/container-test/plugin-samples)**
Demonstrates how to insert special colored notifications and alerts.

**[Code Blocks](/doku/first-level/second-level-b/container-test/code-blocks)**
Shows how to correctly display code samples from various programming languages.

**[Image Embedding](/doku/first-level/second-level-b/container-test/image-embedding)**
Shows how to embed an image on a page and how to change its size.

**[Emoji Embedding](/doku/first-level/second-level-b/container-test/emoji)**
Shows how to use emojis with dynamic resizing using CSS classes.

### Direct link to the container tab

!!!!+= An automatically generated container tab is created by not using a `default.md` file inside the folder. An example can be this **[item](/doku/first-level/second-level-b/container-test)**.
