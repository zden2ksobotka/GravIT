## You are on the first level.

! This page serves as a hub. In the menu (and in the links below), you can see that the content is divided into two main branches: **A** and **B**.

!! This demonstrates how you can have an "introductory" text (this one) on one level while simultaneously linking to several sub-categories.

### Where to go next?

Explore both branches to see different structuring methods:

1.  **[Go to Branch A](/doku/first-level/second-level-a)** - Standard continuation to the next level.
2.  **[Go to Branch B](/doku/first-level/second-level-b)** - A demonstration using a "container" without an index.
